This is a **React-based Quiz App** created as a personal project to **refresh and reinforce my understanding of React**. It covers essential React concepts like component-based architecture, state management, and props handling, while providing a simple, interactive quiz experience.

## Project Overview

The app presents a series of multiple-choice questions, tracks user selections, calculates the score in real-time, and displays a results summary at the end. The app is built using **React.js** and styled with **CSS**.

### Key Features:
- **Component-based architecture**: The app is divided into reusable React components for questions, answers, and score display.
- **State management**: React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) are used to manage the state of the quiz, including the user's selected answers and the current question.
- **Dynamic quiz flow**: Questions are dynamically rendered, and the user is guided through the quiz, with scores calculated on the fly.
- **Instant feedback**: The app provides immediate feedback by showing the correct answers after the quiz is completed.

## Technologies Used:
- **React.js**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **JavaScript**: For the core functionality and logic.
- **CSS**: For styling the app and making it responsive.
